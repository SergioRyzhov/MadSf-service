# MadSf-service

### Meme API

This project implements a RESTful API for managing memes. It allows users to perform CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on memes, including uploading images for each meme. The API is built using FastAPI, SQLAlchemy with async support for database operations, and integrates with an object storage service like MinIO for image uploads.
